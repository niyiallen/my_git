Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people.  In practice, groups
like to use a central hub/cloud stored on the web rather than on someoneâ€™s laptop so that all collaborators
can easily access the repository.  Git is so popular because of websites like Github and BitBucket which make
collaboration so easy.
