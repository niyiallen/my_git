Hello World
Remember, our local repository still contains our earlier work, but the remote repository on GitHub doesnâ€™t
contain any files yet.  The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the GitHub
repository a remote for the local repository.  The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string
we need to identify it.  Since we have already created a repository on our local computer, we are interested
in the instructions in the second box.  Making sure we are in the my
thesis directory locally...
